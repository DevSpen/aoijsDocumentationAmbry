The properties `channel` and `executeOnStartup` are optional.

## Usage:

code: `
...
`,
channel: "channel id",
executeOnStartup: true/false,
every: ms
})
```

## Example command:

bot.loopCommand({

executeOnStartup: true,
every: 500000
})

/*
This command will send 'hi' to the given channel id every 5 minutes. 
ExecuteOnStartup means when the bot starts/comes online, the loop will start
*/
```
